Greetings! How is your day?
Is your day going alright? I very much hope so.
Hello! How are you?
How's your day, because it will get a lot better from this point on!
What's up? The roof of course. Unless you are outdoors.
Good morning! Or afternoon, or evening, or night? Who knows what time it is right now.
